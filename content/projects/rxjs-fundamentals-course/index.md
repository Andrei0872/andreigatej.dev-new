## About

I took part in creating an [RxJS course](https://this-is-learning.github.io/rxjs-fundamentals-course/) that focuses on the fundamentals. It was a great experience to collaborate with folks from [This is Learning](https://github.com/this-is-learning) to produce this course, which definitely contributed to my growth as a developer.

The part of the course I was involved the most in is [How RxJS is used by Angular](https://this-is-learning.github.io/rxjs-fundamentals-course/docs/part-4).
