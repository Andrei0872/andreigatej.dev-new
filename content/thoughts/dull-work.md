This title perfectly describes one of the lessons I've got after the years spent at university. But my university experience is a topic for another day(I should finish it first, should be done by July 2023). 

I'm a curious person and I enjoy pursuing things that spark my curiosity even more. Of course, that's not always possible. Sometimes you have no choice but to deal with situations that are _decent_ from an excitement point of view and sometimes with situations that seem completely boring.

I have found that the **most inefficient** thing to do when dealing with _dull work_ is to complain about it. It simply has to be done and there is nothing you can do to change that. 

Then, I realized that sometimes doing the _dull work_ can bring some unexpected benefits.

For example, migrating the old articles(and other markdown files) from the old portfolio website to the new one involved some manual work. Upon finishing the _boring task_, I realized that I became even more familiar with Vim. That work that I initially considered dull turned out to involve some flows that I haven't been exposed to before.

My **conclusion** is that one should simply embrace whatever comes their way, even more so when it's about things that one simply can't control.
