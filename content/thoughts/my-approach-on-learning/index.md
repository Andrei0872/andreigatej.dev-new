## About me

I'm a pragmatic person. Sometimes, very pragmatic.

At the beginning of my programming journey, I obsessively saved every new resource(e.g. articles, videos) that I would stumble upon. Then, when I looked at the immense pile of resources that resulted, I felt overwhelmed. At the same time, I felt that I really wanted to explore those resources. However, there is only so much time in a day. Not to mention that properly learning about a new topic also requires a great deal of effort.

I deeply knew that I would never be able to go through all the saved links. But, it may not be necessary to do so in order to become the best developer I can humanly be. 

## How I approach learning these days

Now that I have acquired some more experience in programming, I realized that, when it comes to expanding one's knowledge, it's better to follow one certain path at a time. _At a time_ might simply mean a day, a week, a month or more.

Since I'm a fan of thorough knowledge, I thought myself: _If I really want to learn about the topic X, then I will set up some time when I'll essentially 'devour' information from the Internet_. So, for example, although I find it interesting to find out the how TCP really works, watching a few videos today and then having a _break_ of 2 weeks does not actually bring any benefits. Instead, I could set up a few weeks when I'll be studying about TCP in my free time, while also making sure that I get some practical knowledge as well(e.g. implementing the protocol myself).

My strategy(and hope) is that, as my knowledge expands more and more, the *dots* will eventually connect.

## Conclusion

My preferred approach to learning would be to follow a certain direction and deeply learn things along the way. I can always switch paths(which it's hard not do to - there are so many interesting topics to learn about), but I make sure the _switching frequency_ is not disruptive and does not affect the learning experience.
